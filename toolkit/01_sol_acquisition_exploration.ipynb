    "Theme of the exercise: **understand the impact of your communication on social networks**. A real life situation: the marketing team needs help in identifying which were the most engaging posts they made on social platforms to prepare their next [AdWords](https://www.google.com/adwords/) campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you probably don't have a company (yet?), you can either use your own social network profile as if it were the company's one or choose an established entity, e.g. EPFL. You will need to be registered in FB or Twitter to generate access tokens. If you're not, either ask a classmate to create a token for you or create a fake / temporary account for yourself (no need to follow other people, we can fetch public data).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the exercise, you should have two datasets (Facebook & Twitter) and have used them to answer the following questions, for both Facebook and Twitter.\n",
    "1. How many followers / friends / likes has your chosen profile ?\n",
    "2. How many posts / tweets in the last year ?\n",
    "3. What were the 5 most liked posts / tweets ?\n",
    "4. Plot histograms of number of likes and comments / retweets.\n",
    "5. Plot basic statistics and an histogram of text lenght.\n",
    "6. Is there any correlation between the lenght of the text and the number of likes ?\n",
    "7. Be curious and explore your data. Did you find something interesting or surprising ?\n",
    "    1. Create at least one interactive plot (with bokeh) to explore an intuition (e.g. does the posting time plays a role)."
